Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Basic Linear Optimizer (Week 1)
Build single lineup optimizer without correlations

 Create lineup_optimizer.py with PuLP/CVXPY
 Implement DraftKings constraints (50k salary, position requirements)
 Test with Week 17 2024 data
 Validate lineups meet all requirements

Phase 2: Correlation Layer (Week 2)
Add position correlations from historical data

 Calculate correlations from 2022-2024 nfl_data_py
 Store in data/correlations.json
 Apply correlation adjustments to projections
 Test correlation impact on lineup composition

Phase 3: Stacking Rules (Week 3)
Implement DFS stacking strategies

 Add QB-WR stack enforcement
 Add game stack logic (4+ from same game)
 Add bring-back player logic
 Test stack diversity across multiple lineups

Phase 4: Multi-Lineup Generation (Week 4)
Generate diverse lineup portfolio

 Implement diversity constraints
 Add exposure settings (max 50% for any player)
 Generate 20-150 lineups for GPPs
 Test uniqueness metrics
