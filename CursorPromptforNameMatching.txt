Goal: Master Sheet to train Model

n working with NFL DFS data, ALWAYS use the existing crosswalk/master sheet infrastructure instead of trying to match directly from DK slates to NFL API data. Here's the workflow:
Load DK slate (contains current salaries, opponents, slate info)
Load master sheet (contains player_id crosswalks, historical data, join keys)
Create join keys using: clean_name|norm_team|norm_pos format
Merge datasets using pd.merge() on the join_key column
Use master sheet's player_id to get NFL API data (NOT DK slate IDs)
Key Functions to Use:
clean_name() - removes Jr./Sr./III, special chars, converts to lowercase
norm_team() - standardizes team abbreviations
norm_pos() - standardizes position codes
join_key = clean_name + "|" + norm_team + "|" + norm_pos
Why This Works:
DK slate IDs (like 56789) â‰  NFL API player_ids (like 00-0033106)
Master sheet already has the crosswalk between different ID systems
Join keys handle name/team/position variations across datasets
This is the established pattern in your codebase
DO NOT:
Try to match DK slate IDs directly to NFL API
Skip the master sheet/crosswalk step
Assume player names/teams are identical across sources
DO:
Always check what master sheets are available in data/processed/
Use the master sheet's player_id field for NFL API lookups
Create standardized join keys for reliable matching
Leverage the existing data infrastructure
Remember: The crosswalk approach is the foundation of your data pipeline. Use it every time!
This prompt should ensure I remember to use the proper crosswalk/master sheet approach instead of trying to reinvent the wheel
